# pierrot-excelexport-demo

This small Demo shows how to implements an Excel Export as it should be. Most people **are not aware about the fact that, starting from version 4.2.0,
Spring provides an Interface** *AbstractXlsxView* for that and program the Excel Export manually which is not necessary.  
See the Spring API Documentation [AbstractXlsxView API](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/document/AbstractXlsxView.html)
and the Spring Documentation [PDF and Excel](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#mvc-view-document).
